I fixed the real time update issue on the recipient side but now the sender does not show the updated conversation after sending a message
however the conversations are updated correctly

there doesnt seem to be an initial state in the reducer

The child components of sidebar were not rerendering, in the reducer I had to make a copy of the convo object before updating the state, because the previous
props and new props were the same

Used the reverse() function to display the messages in the correct order

Fixed messages not appearing right away by changing data.text to data.message in thunkCreators.js addCoversation function
